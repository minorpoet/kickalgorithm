[237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/)

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

写一个方法，删除单链表中的一个节点（排除尾节点）， 只给出访问被删除节点的唯一引用

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
