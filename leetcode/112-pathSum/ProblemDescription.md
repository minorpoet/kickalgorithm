[112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/)

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

给定一个二叉树和一个和 sum ，判断是否存在从跟节点到叶子节点的路径使得该路径上所有节点值加起来等于 sum。

For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
```
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
