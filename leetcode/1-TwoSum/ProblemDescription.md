 [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

给定一个整型数组，返回两个数的子数组，这两个数加起来的和为给定的值

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

假设每个组输入参数只会有一个解，同时一个元素只能使用一次

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
